        <h2>"SOMETIMES WE NEED TO DISCONNECT IN ORDER TO RECONNECT WITH WHAT MATTERS."</h2>
        <p><span> 59.5% </span> of the global population access the Internet</p>
        <p>That's <span> 4.66 billion </span> active users worldwide</p>
        <p>The world has never been more connected</p>
        <p>and yet it has never been more <span> disconnected </span></p>
        <p>Toxic online behaviors have been on the rise</p>
        <p>hate speech</p>
        <p>sexual harassment</p>
        <p>flaming</p>
        <p>but...</p>
        <p>WHY?</p>
      </div>

      <div class="dissociativeAnonymity">
        <h2>DISSOCIATIVE ANONYMITY</h2>
        <p>Moving around the internet</p>
        <p>the people you encounter</p>
        <p>can't easily tell who you are.</p>
        <p>People only know what you tell them about yourself.</p>
        <p>When people have the opportunity to separate their actions from their real world and identity</p>
        <p>they feel <span> less vulnerable </span> about opening up.</p>
        <p>Whatever they say</p>
        <p>or do</p>
        <p>can't be directly linked to the rest of their lives.</p>
        <p>They don't have to own their behavior by acknowledging it within the full context of who they really are.</p>
        <p>When acting out hostile feelings</p>
        <p>the person doesn't have to take responsibility for those actions</p>
        <p>they might even convince themselves that those behaviors</p>
        <p><span> aren't me at all.</span></p>
        <p>We become</p>
        <p><span> disconnected.</span></p>
      </div>

      <div class="internetToxicity">
        <p>The roots of internet toxicity stem from dissociative anonymity.</p>
        <p>And since the boom of social media</p>
        <p>and interacting with strangers online has become a lot more common</p>
        <p>moderating such discourse has been a technical and ethical challenge for many platforms.</p>
        <p>While freedom of speech is important</p>
        <p>creating an inclusive platform for meaningful discourse is also necessary.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="netNeutrality">
        <p>Ethically, punishing toxic online behavior contradicts net neutrality</p>
        <h2>Net Neutrality: the principle that all Internet communications must be treated equally and must not be discriminated against based on user, content, website, platform, etc.</h2>
        <p>The change should happen among people instead</p>
        <p>People should disconnect their cyber-self from their real self</p>
        <p>build an emotional and mental barrier</p>
        <p>care less about what other people say</p>
        <p>and focus on <span> yourself.</span></p>

        <p>Alternatively...</p>
        <p>Net neutrality is already being undermined</p>
        <p>with internet toxicity preventing equal access.</p>
        <p>The bullied are <span> afraid </span></p>
        <p>and become <span> silent.</span></p>
        <p>How could we technologically reconnect</p>
        <p>and <span> punish </span> bad online behavior?</p>
      </div>

      <div class="moderation">
        <h2>MODERATION</h2>
        <p>Moderation solutions already exist.</p>
        <p>Human and bot moderators read millions of messages a day.</p>
        <p>When a message is deemed as toxic or inapporpriate</p>
        <p>the toxic user is punished</p>
        <p>but the current punishments are <span> work-around-able </span></p>
        <p>time-outs are short</p>
        <p>bans are short</p>
        <p>alternate accounts can be made</p>
        <p>The disconnection between the people and the punishments prevent the effects of a punishment</p>
      </div>

      <div class="hardwareBanning">
        <h2>HARDWARE BANNING</h2>
        <p>A forceful <span> reconnection </span> through hardware banning could do the trick.</p>
        <p>Repeated toxic behavior</p>
        <p>resulting in a hardware ban</p>
        <p>prevents access to the website, platform, or application through the same banned hardware.</p>
        <p>The consequences of your actions will be <span> cemented.</span></p>
